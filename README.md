Using your computer’s webcam, I built a face-swap application for you and your friends or family. I used a pre-trained face detector (gotten from here <href=“https://github.com/opencv/opencv/raw/master/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml“> to identify faces in images and then in the webcam. Finally, I swapped every pair of faces in the webcam for a picturesque, self-made Instagram-ready photo.

Before the swap:
